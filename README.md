# Bluetooth-controlled-Car
In this project I have made a Arduino based car which is controlled over a Mobile device. The phone sends a Bluetooth signal to the Hc05 module, the module receives the signal and passes it on to the Arduino board via the Tx Rx pins. According to the received data Arduino sends digital signals to he L298 motor driver to run the motors.
